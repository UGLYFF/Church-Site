        <h1>Welcome to RCCG Teens!</h1>
        <p>
        At RCCG Teens, we’re more than just a church community—we're a family. We believe in empowering the next generation of leaders, worshippers, and changemakers through the love of Christ. Our mission is to help every teen grow in their faith, discover their God-given talents, and build lifelong relationships rooted in love and purpose.
